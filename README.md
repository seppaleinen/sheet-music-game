# Sheet Music Game

The idea is to create an app/browser-game that teaches you to read sheet music
Kind of like [Stepmania](https://www.stepmania.com/) but for actual instruments and real notation

### Todo
* Basic skeleton for app/browser
  * react-native?
* Some way to reliably "hear" the notes being played [Example](https://alexanderell.is/posts/tuner/)
* 

### Ideas
* Modes
  * Prima Vista - Generate a random score and grade on how many hits/misses
  * Actual Songs - Inputting or Pre-inserting actual scores and playing along
  * Tutorial - Play-along with visible cues on where on the instrument the note is to be played
  * Circle of fifths training modulw
  * Eartraining for hearing notes and chords?
  *
